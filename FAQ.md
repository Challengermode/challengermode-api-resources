# FAQ
* What can I use the public API for?
You're currently able to extract information about Spaces, tournaments and individual matches from Challengermode. 
To integrate a game with the API directly, reach out to our [partnerships team](mailto:esports@challengermode.com).

* Can I get game-specific stats from the API?
Unfortunately not. Due to policies and terms of use of the game developer APIs, we're currently unable to provide detailed in-game stats (e.g. kills per player in Leage of Legends).

* Does it cost anything to integrate with Challengermode?
It's currently free to integrate with the API but there are rate limits in place. Get started by [exploring the docs](https://www.challengermode.com/developers/docs). Certain features and capabilities may only be available to paying partners. Reach out to our [partnerships team](mailto:esports@challengermode.com) to learn more about our paid features.

* How do I get a refresh key?
In order to get a refresh key, you'll have to [create an application](https://www.challengermode.com/developers/applications) in our developer portal, which then needs to be first **submitted and then approved**. When going out of BETA, unapproved applications will also be able to make requests, but with very restricted rate limits. 

After your app is approved, you will be able to generate refresh keys directly on your [Application](https://www.challengermode.com/developers/applications).
